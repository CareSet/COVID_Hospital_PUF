### Why would the number of beds change week over week?

All of the bed numbers in the hospital data set are based on staffed beds.  It is possible that more beds exist in the hospital but only have staff to cover the number of beds reported.  This is why itâ€™s possible to see a variance in the number of beds reported as well as physically added or eliminating beds from the hospital.
