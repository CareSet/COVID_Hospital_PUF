### How to examine regional (city/county) data with this dataset, what is new?

The impact on hospitals is very localized. The problem with releasing aggregated pictures is that this does NOT account for the way COVID-19 is affecting specific facilities. Aggregations will miss the fact that some facilities are at 105% capacity and others are less utilized. This is the reason why such data is released: to show a specific facilityâ€™s status, which could be dramatically different from the status of other hospitals in the same city, county and state.
