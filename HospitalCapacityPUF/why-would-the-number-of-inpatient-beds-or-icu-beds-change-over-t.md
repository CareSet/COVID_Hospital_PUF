### Why would the number of inpatient beds or ICU beds change over time?

The reporting is rarely concerned with the number of beds at a facility. The issue is how many beds are staffed. If you have 100 beds in the hospital and 10 beds in an ICU, but a hospital only has enough nurses and doctors to support 50 of the hospital beds and 5 ICU beds, then the hospital would report 50 beds and 5 ICU beds available that day. As a result, the “bed capacity” is related to the number of actual beds in a facility and also the staffing available at the hospital. Over time, this number will fluctuate slightly.
