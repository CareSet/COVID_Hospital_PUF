### What about pediatric data?
There is information about pediatric cases and pediatric hospitals included in the dataset. However, there is currently no information about how full pediatric ICUs are in this data release. This is due to a strategic decision in the underlying reporting infrastructure. Generally pediatric data is not reported, given that pediatric infection is relatively rare, and in order to ensure that reporting is as simple as possible for hospitals.
