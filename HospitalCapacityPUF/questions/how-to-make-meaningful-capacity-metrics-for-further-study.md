### How to make meaningful capacity metrics for further study?
As you seek to create meaningful metrics from this data, be aware that there are some “very small” numbers in some rows of data that should receive special attention in order to get meaningful information from metrics/ratios. Anyone analyzing this data, should remain aware of invalid ratios created by very small numbers.   	

| Example Metrics for Adult Hospitalizations  | Formula |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| How full is the hospital with adult confirmed and suspected COVID patients?  | total_adult_patients_hospitalized_confirmed_and_suspected_covid_7_day_avg/ all_adult_hospital_inpatient_beds_7_day_avg |
| Total staffed adult ICU bed fullness? (including COVID and non-COVID ICU usage)  | staffed_adult_icu_bed_occupancy_7_day_avg/ total_staffed_adult_icu_beds_7_day_avg  |
| How full is the adult ICU of confirmed and suspected COVID patients? | staffed_icu_adult_patients_confirmed_and_suspected_covid_7_day_avg/ total_staffed_adult_icu_beds_7_day_avg  |
| What proportion of currently hospitalized adult patients are COVID patients?  | total_adult_patients_hospitalized_confirmed_and_suspected_covid_7_day_avg /all_adult_hospital_inpatient_bed_occupied_7_day_avg  |



This is a list of ratios that it is not possible to calculate in this data release: 


* There are several pediatric ratios that are not possible to calculate.
