### I checked a hospital’s dashboard and the numbers are slightly different from the ones in this file. Why is that? 


First, it could be a data entry or aggregation error. (There are ways to provide feedback on this data at healthdata.gov.) However, there could be reasons for small discrepancies between an individual facility’s dashboard or internal reporting and this file, that are not mistakes of any kind. For one, this file provides a snapshot of the previous week’s data, so an individual facility’s reporting may be more up to date. The aggregations for hospital dashboards are typically daily, while this dataset is aggregated across a week (Friday-Thurs), and does not not represent any specific day. There could also be differences in data definitions between the ones HHS has settled on and any particular local facility. It seems trivial but what it means to have a “bed” is not actually that simple. This is also a frequent reason for small differences between state-level reports and national reports.
