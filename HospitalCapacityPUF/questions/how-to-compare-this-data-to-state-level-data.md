### How to compare this data to state-level data?
There are several differences between the data export process for the facility level and state-level data. They are aggregated over different time periods as well as at different regional aggregations. As a result, there will always be some differences between an analysis that is based on the state-level public use file vs a state-based analysis that is drawn from the state-field in the facility-aggregated dataset. There are multiple differences between these data frames, including data that is withheld for privacy reasons, that will make a perfect matchup between different Public Use Files (PUFs) impossible. This includes redactions resulting in -999999 in a given field.
