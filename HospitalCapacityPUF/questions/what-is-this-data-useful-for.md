### What is this data useful for?
Any analysis that seeks to understand how the COVID crisis has impacted local communities will be improved by considering this data. School systems that are making the decision about whether to open or close or how often students should be in class, can use this dataset to make those decisions based on how local hospitals are being impacted by COVID. Local fire departments can use this data as they direct their ambulances toward one hospital or another. (Although more recent capacity data will frequently be available to fire departments). States can use this data in order to validate their own understanding of their communityâ€™s needs. Journalists can use this story to better communicate how the COVID pandemic and the COVID response is impacting local communities. Academic researchers can use this data to understand the associations of hospitalizations, hospital capacity, and local community characteristics. 


There continue to be misinformation campaigns that deny the usefulness of masks or detract from other CDC recommendations, like social distancing. Many of these campaigns emphasize that the severity of the disease is less than it actually is. This dataset can be used to understand and model the regional impact of these misinformation campaigns, as well as provide direct evidence needed to combat them.
