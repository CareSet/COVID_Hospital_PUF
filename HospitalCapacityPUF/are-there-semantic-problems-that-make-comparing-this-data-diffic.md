### Are there semantic problems that make comparing this data difficult? 

Yes.

There are many semantic problems between different COVID datasets, but two significant semantic problems should be highlighted. 



1. The first is the distinction between “confirmed” and “suspected” COVID-19 cases. Sometimes these are merged into a single field called “cases”. This impacts how ICU beds are reported as well case counts. 



2. The second is what is meant by an “available bed”. Sometimes this number means “beds that are properly staffed” and sometimes this means “the number of literal beds”. 



Distinctions like this account for a substantial amount of the differences between data reported from various levels of government.
