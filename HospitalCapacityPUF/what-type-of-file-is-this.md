### What type of file is this?

This is a comma delimited field file, called a “CSV file” for short.

CSV files are an open file format defined in [IETF RFC4180](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180) 

Generally government agencies are required to prefer data releases in open formats. 





There are many tutorials available online about how to import CSV files into your favorite data analysis platform. Also this file will open directly in any modern spreadsheet software.
