### What is this data and where does it come from?

Each row of data in this file represents the COVID-19 related capacity information for a single hospital facility, over the course of a seven day period. (Friday-Thursday). This data is reported by nearly every hospital to the Federal Government in the US each day.  This means that each row of data is based on the aggregated reporting for the previous week. 

 

Every day most hospitals in the U.S. are required to report information on the following topics to the federal government: 





* Hospital capacity, including information on ICU capacity and available ventilators

* Staffing levels, including any shortages

* How many patients are coming into the hospital with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases

* Many other relevant details that public health officials need to properly coordinate COVID responses 





To understand exactly what is in the data it is important to understand what is reported by hospitals each day. Please refer to the current version of the [COVID-19 Guidance for Hospital Reporting and FAQs For Hospitals, Hospital Laboratory, and Acute Care Facility Data Reporting](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/covid-19-faqs-hospitals-hospital-laboratory-acute-care-facility-data-reporting.pdf)





This data is reported daily from hospitals, either through the Teletracking system or through reports sent via State-level health departments, and entered into the central HHS Protect database.
