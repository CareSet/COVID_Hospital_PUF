### What is HHS Protect Data and its role in COVID-19 planning?

The Central HHS Protect database powers the highest level of COVID coordination in the United States. There are multiple Federal resources, including access to doses of Remdesivir, which are allocated based on the daily hospital reporting that ultimately goes into the HHS Protect Database. Other important resources include doctors from the DOD and other Federal teams that can be used to augment staff at local hospitals in emergency situations. 





All of the decisions about how these resources are distributed are sourced from insights gained from the data in the HHS Protect Database. This database is the most comprehensive and centrally-maintained picture of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Federal Government. As a result, this is likely to be the closest data picture to ground-truth on the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. 





This is not the first dataset to be released to the public from HHS Protect. There is a publicly available website that features the data released from HHS Protect at [https://protect-public.hhs.gov/](https://protect-public.hhs.gov/).
