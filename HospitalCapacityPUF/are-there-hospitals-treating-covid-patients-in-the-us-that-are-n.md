### Are there hospitals treating COVID patients in the U.S. that are not represented in this data?

Yes, there are several large groups of facilities that are not represented in this data. 





US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Hospitals, Defense Health Agency (DHA) and Indian Health Service (IHS) hospitals are not included in this data release. The data from these two federal agencies are included in the HHS Protect database, but the release of that data is not up to HHS (the agency releasing this data file), we hope to convince the VA and IHS to have parallel data releases, using equivalent data structures.





Psychiatric and rehabilitation hospitals are also omitted, as they are not centrally involved in the COVID-19 response.
